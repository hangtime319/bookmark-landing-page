Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

# Bookmark Landing Page

A responsive landing page for a bookmarking service, built as a challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Bookmark landing page" challenge from Frontend Mentor. It's a fully responsive landing page that showcases a conceptual bookmark manager. The project focuses on creating a clean, modern, and adaptive layout, with special attention to CSS styling, responsive design, and interactive components like tabbed content and a FAQ section.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the page content, including sections, headers, and forms.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For all the styling, including advanced layouts using Flexbox and Grid, custom properties for colors, and responsive design with media queries.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** To handle the interactive features of the page, such as the tabbed navigation to switch between different sections of the app and to manage the accordion-like functionality of the FAQ section.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

* A tabbed interface to show different features.
* A section for downloads.
* A frequently asked questions (FAQ) section.
* A contact form.
* A responsive design that looks great on all devices.

## Features

* **Responsive Layout:** The design adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
* **Interactive Tabs:** The "Features" section uses JavaScript to switch between different content views.
